All example data files are in the <<sample_input_files>> folder

Usage:
  """
    import pygmap
    
    pygmap.create_map(input_file, output_file, options)    
    
  """
    
    where:
    input_file contains locations in "<latitude> <longitude> <[color_info?]> <(extra_info+)?>" format
    locations.txt is such a sample file with only the location information
    output_file is where the map in HTML format will be created
    options are for color and extra information to be displayed for the point on map
    
    eg: "pygmap.create("locations.txt", "map.html", [False, False])"
    
    Options:
    The format of options is as follows: (True/False are boolean values)
    [color_info=True/False, extra_info=True/False, polyline=True/False]
    
    1)  If color_info is True, then an extra column is required in the input file
        where color codes are as follows
            0 - 00FFFF (aqua)
            1 - 99FF00 (flourescent green)
            2 - blue
            3 - CC9900 (brown)
            4 - FF00FF (pink)
            5 - FF0000 (red)
            6 - FF9900 (orange)
            7 - FFFF00 (yellow)
            
        An example input is "locations_color.txt"    

    2)  If extra_info is True, then all columns after the color column (if exists),
        will be concatenated into a string and used as a message for that points
        marker(displayed as information box upon clicking marker in map)  
        
        An example input is "locations_color_extrainfo.txt" and "locations_extrainfo.txt"
        
    3)  If polyline is True, then the given points will be joined by a line in the same
        given order
